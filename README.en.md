Pagaris button (widget) that can be included in websites (e.g. a product or checkout page) to show buyers how they can use Pagaris to pay their purchase in monthly installments.

# Demo

See [demo/demo.html](demo/demo.html)

# Features

1. The button explains the buyer how Pagaris works, without disrupting their purchase experience
2. If an `amount` is given (e.g. unit price of a product or total of a cart):
  - It's validated to check if it can be financed by Pagaris. If it isn't nothing is shown.
  - One or more example loan offers can be shown
3. If a valid referrer (`ref`) is given, the shown content can include the merchant's name and logo

# Usage

In each page or layout in which you want to show the button (e.g. "product", "cart" or "checkout"):

1. Add `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pagaris/placement/src/pagaris_placement.js"></script>` to include the needed JS file
2. Add an `<pagaris-placement>` element where you wish to show the button. You can add one or more buttons per page (e.g. search page or category page with multiple products)
3. Add the `amount` attribute to specify the product price or cart total in MXN (Mexican pesos)
4. Add the `ref` attribute to add merchant branding to the added button and content. This will be assigned by Pagaris, so you can contact us by email or chat to help you

#### Example

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/pagaris/placement/src/pagaris_placement.js" defer></script>
<pagaris-placement amount="5800.95" ref="[referrer code]">
</pagaris-placement>
```

### Change amount dynamically

If the amount changes (e.g. buyer changed a product quantity or changes cart products), the amount attribute can be changed and the content will be updated automatically

```js
const pagaris = document.querySelector('pagaris-placement')
pagaris.amount = 9928
```

### Add new button dynamically

If you wish to add a new button, you can create a new `<pagaris-placement>` element.

```js
const pagaris = document.createElement('pagaris-placement')
pagaris.amount = 3991.99
pagaris.ref = 'ref'

document.querySelector('body').append(pagaris)
```
